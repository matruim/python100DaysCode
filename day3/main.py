You knock, but there's no answer. You push the door open and step inside.

"I know the creature you speak of," she says. "It's a trickster, and it's led many a traveler astray. But you were wise not to follow it."

She invites you to sit by the stream and rest for a while.

        You approach the brightly colored doors with caution. You take a deep breath and reach out to the blue door, turning the handle and stepping inside.

Inside the room, you find a treasure trove of gold, jewels, and other valuable artifacts. You smile to yourself, grateful for your good fortune.

But wait - you hear a creaking noise behind you. You turn around to see the red door slowly opening, revealing a dark and ominous hallway.

You realize that you have made the right choice in choosing the blue door, and you quickly gather the treasure and make your way out of the building.

        You approach the brightly colored doors with caution, but you suddenly stop in your tracks. You realize that you don't have to choose either door. You take a step back and look at the structure with a critical eye.

As you examine the building, you notice a small button hidden in the wall. You press it, and a hidden door slides open, revealing a small room filled with treasures.

You smile to yourself, realizing that sometimes the answer isn't always a binary choice. You take some time to explore the hidden room, gathering as many treasures as you can carry.

You leave the building feeling satisfied and happy with your unexpected discovery. You continue on your journey, wondering what other surprises lie ahead.
